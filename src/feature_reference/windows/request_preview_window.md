# Request Preview Window

The request preview window is a detailed display of a certain request. It will give us the detail information about the request.

As we can see, this window gives us more detailed information about the request, starting from the *request name*, *name of the instance* that made the request, *description*, and *the leftovers* (object requested)

### Donation bar

Donor could use this bar to give the specific amount of donation that they want to give. We could use the plus or minus button to add or reduce the amount of donation. Or, we could just type a specific amount directly to the bar.
