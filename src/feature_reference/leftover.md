# Leftover

Leftover is the building block of the interactions between [Donor](./account.md) and [Donee](./account.md). Leftover can be viewed as items to donate and request.

Leftover can be anything like foods, clothes, materials, tools, etc.

Leftovers are contained within a [Request](./request.md). Leftovers within a request can then be donated by a [Donor](./account.md).

## Creating a Leftover for a Request
Creating a new leftover can be done in the [Request Page](./windows/main_window/request.md) by the [Donee](./account.md) that owns the [Request](./request.md).
1. On the [Request Page](./windows/main_window/request.md), if you are a [Donee](./account.md) that owns the [Request](./request.md), click on Add Leftover button.
2. It will show the new leftover form. You can fill in all the necessary details of your new leftover.
3. Click Add to add the new leftover for the [Request](./request.md).

## Donating a Leftover to a Request
Donating to a leftover can be done in the [Request Page](./windows/main_window/request.md) by any [Donor](./account.md).
1. On the [Request Page](./windows/main_window/request.md), you can input the number of leftovers you want to donate in the box of each leftover in the [Request](./request.md). Otherwise you can also use the plus (+) or minus (-) button to add or subract the leftover by 1. You can leave it on 0 if you don't plan to donate on a leftover.
2. Click Donate to donate the leftover(s) for the [Request](./request.md).
