# Leftover

Leftover is the building block of the interactions between Donor and Donee. Leftover can be viewed as items to donate and request.

Leftover can be anything like foods, clothes, materials, tools, etc.

Leftovers are contained within a [Request](./request.md). Leftovers within a request can then be donated by a Donor.
