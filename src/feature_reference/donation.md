# Donation

Donation is a track record of [Donor]()'s donation to a [Leftover](). Donation is automatically created after a [Donor]() donated a leftover.

Donation can only contain 1 type of leftover but can contain multiple amount of that leftover. Donating multiple types leftover in bulk will create multiple donations.
