# Creating an account on Leftover Harmony

When opening the application you are prompted to log in to an account in the [Authentication Window](../windows/authentication_window.md). This requires the user to sign up if they haven't made an account previously.

## Signing up for a new account
Leftover Harmony has two account roles, Donor and Donee (see [Account](../account.md)) where the sign up process between them are slightly different.
